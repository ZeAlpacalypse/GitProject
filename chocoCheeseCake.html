        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>24 choclate sandwich cookies (Oreos)</li>
            <li>28 grams confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips or bittersweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
            <li>680g cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of unbleached all purpose flour</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375째F. Lightly grease a 9" springform pan.</li>
            <li>
              To make the crust: Crush, grind, or otherwise pulverize the cookies
              together with the sugar; a food processor works well here. If desired,
              set aside about a tablespoon of the crumbs to garnish the finished
              cake.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the melted butter, processing briefly or stirring until the
              mixture is evenly crumbly. Press the moist crumbs into the bottom and
              partway up the sides of the prepared pan. Place the pan on a baking
              sheet, to catch any potential drips of butter
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and set it
              aside as you make the filling.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the oven heat to 350째F</li>
            <li>
              To make the filling: Combine the milk and chocolate chips in a small
              saucepan or microwave-safe bowl or large cup. Heat, stirring
              frequently, until the chips melt and the mixture is smooth. Remove
              from the heat, stir in the espresso powder, and set the mixture aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, beat together the cream cheese and sugar at
              low speed, until thoroughly combined. Scrape the bottom and sides of
              the bowl, and beat briefly, just until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating to combine after each one.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vanilla, then the flour.</li>
            <li>
              Add the chocolate/milk mixture, beating slowly until thoroughly
              combined. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl; beat briefly, just
              until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the batter atop the crust in the pan. Place the pan on a baking
              sheet; this will make it easier to get the cake in and out of the oven
              safely.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake the cake (remember, the oven temperature should be 350째F) for 45
              to 50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the cake 1" from the
              outside edge comes out clean. A digital thermometer, inserted at the
              same point, should read 175째F. The center may not look set; that's OK.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn off the oven, crack the door open several inches, and allow the
              cake to cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove the cake from the oven,
              and set it on a rack to finish cooling. When it's completely cool,
              cover the cake, and refrigerate it until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>
              Garnish the cake with the reserved crumbs. Serve it in small slices,
              with whipped cream and berries.
            </li>
          </ol>
